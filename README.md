# divpart: Hierarchical diversity partitioning using effective numbers in R

### 
This package calculates alpha, beta, and gamma diversity for various indices of diversity (species richness, Shannon entropy, Simpson diversity) at successive levels of a hierarchical sampling scheme. 

Diversity indices can incorporate species dissimilarities, such as those from functional traits or phylogenetic trees, and thus can also provide an estimate of functional and phylogenetic turnover across spatial scales.
